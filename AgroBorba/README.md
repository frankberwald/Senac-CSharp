# ERP-Agro-Borba
This is a tiny project that me and my team developed while studying in Senac using C#, MVC and Windows Forms.
Its a simple system that organizes an PetShop operation,its made of 3 views such as the monitoring and editing of the stock, new clients registration and old clients updates, and a panel to register new orders, there are some ideas of making it a mobile and web app, using node, html + css and flutter on mobile.
I pretend on updating it in the future, there may be an issue with the DataGridView on the Order form, but in general the system is working and functional, not hard to use.
